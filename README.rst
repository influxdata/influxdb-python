InfluxDB pre v1.1.0 users
=========================

InfluxDB 1.1.0 was released and it is the new recommended version. InfluxDB 0.8.x users may still use the legacy client by using ``from influxdb.influxdb08 import InfluxDBClient`` instead.

Installation
============

Install, upgrade and uninstall InfluxDB-Python with these commands::

    $ pip install influxdb
    $ pip install --upgrade influxdb
    $ pip uninstall influxdb

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install it with this command::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-influxdb

Dependencies
============

The InfluxDB-Python distribution is supported and tested on Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, PyPy and PyPy3.

**Note:** Python 3.2 is currently untested. See ``.travis.yml``.

Main dependency is:

- Requests: HTTP library for human beings (http://docs.python-requests.org/)


Additional dependencies are:

- pandas: for writing from and reading to DataFrames (http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Sphinx: Tool to create and manage the documentation (http://sphinx-doc.org/)
- Nose: to auto-discover tests (http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- Mock: to mock tests (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock)


Documentation
=============

InfluxDB-Python documentation is available at http://influxdb-python.readthedocs.org

You will need Sphinx_ installed to generate the documentation.

The documentation can be generated by running::

    $ tox -e docs


Generated documentation can be found in the *docs/build/html/* directory.


Examples
========

Here's a basic example (for more see the examples directory)::

    $ python

    >>> from influxdb import InfluxDBClient

    >>> json_body = [
        {
            "measurement": "cpu_load_short",
            "tags": {
                "host": "server01",
                "region": "us-west"
            },
            "time": "2009-11-10T23:00:00Z",
            "fields": {
                "value": 0.64
            }
        }
    ]

    >>> client = InfluxDBClient('localhost', 8086, 'root', 'root', 'example')

    >>> client.create_database('example')

    >>> client.write_points(json_body)

    >>> result = client.query('select value from cpu_load_short;')

    >>> print("Result: {0}".format(result))


Testing
=======

Make sure you have tox by running the following::
